# NeuralPDE
Neural PDE Solver

This branch is for implementing Neural Networks for solving specific PDEs (specified by their differential form). The main branch will hopefully be for solving PDEs with a Gaussian Process whose kernel is learned through a Deep NN. 

The objective is to determine a good prior kernel for modeling PDEs with GPs.

Currently implementing a Neural Network to solve the Laplace Equation in $$\mathcal{R}^2$$.
